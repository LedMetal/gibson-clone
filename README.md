## Latest Update

I have completed the Header component, with the navigation bar complete with all the menus and submenus.

I used <a href="https://material.angular.io/components/menu/overview" target="_blank">Angular Material Menu</a> as a basis of the navigation menu system. It was tricky in terms of the menu's positioning, as well as each subsequent sub menu's relative positioning.

I am also saving all the dummy data into json files, which I will then send out as an Observable from a service.

## Description

This WIP project is a frontend clone of the <a href="https://www.gibson.com/en-US" target="_blank">official Gibson USA website</a>.

Please remember this is a work in progress. I will keep the live site updated with the latest changes in this repository. I'll slowly construct this clone bit by bit, as long as the beauitful guitars don't distract me too much!

## Development

This is app is built with Angular v.17.

This project is a great chance to practice creating an app with the new standalone components structure. Also, I expect I will try using some of the new @ template directives introduced in this version, as well.

I used Gibson's website as a mockup, much like I would get from a UI/UX designer in a professional setting, and have been attempting to replicate every aspect of it from header to footer.

While a lot of the pages have a fairly simple layout, there are still several challenges that I expect to encounter. Specifically speaking, I expect the navigation bar in the header to be a little tricky. However, I expect the combination of Angular Material Menus and some CSS magic will do the trick!

I will try to limit how many third party libraries I use, in an effort to flex my ability to implement a design from scratch.

## Built With

_Programming Language:_ **Angular**, **Typescript**, **SCSS**
